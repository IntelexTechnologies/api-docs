## POST API's 

The following POST APIs are used to modify ACTS data. Options include updating existing records and inserting new records, and you can complete both in the same POST. To insert new records, the primary key is set to 0, while for updates to existing records, the primary key for the existing record is used. You can see an example for this in 4. Facility Attribute Table POST API Endpoint below. 

For large data inserts, we recommend you break data into batch POSTs of up to 500 rows. Large batch POSTs may be throttled or failed, depending on system resources. 

In the current release we have 4 POST API’s available, for the Equipment, Operation, Facility, and Facility Attribute tables. POSTs to these endpoints must be JSON format. 

As described above, to insert to a table, the primary key should be zero – 0. When the record is added to the table it will be assigned the next available incremental primary key.
